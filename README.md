Order the PCBS at e.g. [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) dont forget to add the stencil

Order the parts at e.g. [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) you can upload the BOM to their [uploader](https://www.lcsc.com/bom) and select the "Supplier Part" from the bom as their "LCSC Part Number"

**Assembly**
- Print the mounts
- ![PCB](Images/-1-pcb.jpg)
- Assemble the PCB
- Cut the Extrusions to your desired length
- Lay your led strips into the extrusions
- ![VHB](Images/-2-vhb.jpg)
- Add some vhb to the end of the strip to avoid shorts and stick on your PCB
- ![ACRYLIC](Images/-3-acrylic.jpg)
- Cut the acrylics that your TCRT sticks out
- Be sure to add your power cable before you add the mounts, or to it like me and cutout the bridge
- ![MOUNT](Images/-4-mount.jpg)
- ![MOUNT](Images/-5-mount.jpg)
- Add the mounts to the extrusions, they fit very tight around the acrylic, i used some pliers to get around it
- ![RESULT](Images/-6-result.jpg)
- Mount the lightbars in your drawer, do a testfit as the sensing distance is not this far
- for me it was about 8mm from the drawer front
- ![ACTION](Images/-7-action.mp4)
- it looks so awesome
